# University Parking System – Distributed Architecture

This repository contains the academic implementation of a distributed university parking system designed using a microservices-based architecture.

The project follows domain-driven design principles, containerization with Docker, infrastructure as code using Terraform, and CI/CD pipelines with GitHub Actions.

The implementation is aligned with the technical report submitted for the Distributed Programming course.
